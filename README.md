This is the project for the RNA Sequencing course in the Bioinformatics Master program at the University of Bern.
We analysed RNA sequencing data by aligning them to the human reference genome, then assembling the transcriptome, 
quantifying the expression levels and carrying out differential expression analysis. All scripts used and some output files
produced by them are available in this repository. Output files of larger file size can be found on the computing cluster of the University of Bern at /data/users/lfrei/rna_seq.
