This is the project for the RNA Sequencing course in the Bioinformatics Master program at the University of Bern.
We analysed RNA sequencing data by aligning them to the reference genome, then assembling the transcriptome, 
quantifying the expression levels and carrying out differential expression analysis. All scripts used and some output files
produced by them are available in this repository.
